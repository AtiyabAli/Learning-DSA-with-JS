Q   what is Algorithm

ans Set of intruction to solve a set of problem
    well defined inputs and output
    each steps should be clear
    language independent

Q   Algorithm Analysis

     1. Time complexity (amount of time taken to   compute)
    2. Space complexity (amount of space to be taken to compute any alogorithm)

Notation

Big-O notation - worst case complexity
Omega Notation - Best Case complexity
Theta Notation - Average Case complexity

Time and Space complexity

contant
Linear
Quadratic
